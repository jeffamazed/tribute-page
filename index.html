            <li><span class="bold">1894</span>: The Einstein family moved to Milan, Italy, after his father's business failed. Albert continued his education in Switzerland.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1896</span>: Graduated from the Swiss Federal Polytechnic in Zurich with a degree in physics and mathematics.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1901</span>: Published his first scientific paper, "The Investigation of the State of Aether in Magnetic Fields."</li>
            <li><span class="bold">1905</span>: Published four groundbreaking papers, known as the *Annus Mirabilis* (Miracle Year) papers:
